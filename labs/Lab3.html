	<h1> McDonalds<h1>
  <h2>product</h2>
  <p>McDonald's predominantly sells hamburgers, various types of chicken, chicken sandwiches, French fries, soft drinks, breakfast items, and desserts. In most markets, McDonald's offers salads and vegetarian items, wraps and other localized fare. On a seasonal basis, McDonald's offers the McRib sandwich. Some speculate the seasonality of the McRib adds to its appeal.[30] During March of each year, McDonald's offers a Shamrock Shake to honor Saint Patrick's Day.[31]

  <h2>Mccafe</h2>
  <p>McCafé is a café-style accompaniment to McDonald's restaurants. The concept was created by McDonald's Australia, starting with Melbourne in 1993.[55] As of 2016, most McDonald's in Australia have McCafés located within the existing McDonald's restaurant. In Tasmania, there are McCafés in every restaurant, with the rest of the states quickly following suit.[48] After upgrading to the new McCafé look and feel, some Australian restaurants have noticed up to a 60 percent increase in sales. At the end of 2003, there were over 600 McCafés worldwide.[citation needed]</p>

  <h2>Types of resturaunt</h2>
  <p>Most standalone McDonald's restaurants offer both counter service and drive-through service, with indoor and sometimes outdoor seating.[48] Drive-Thru, Auto-Mac, Pay and Drive, or "McDrive" as it is known in many countries, often has separate stations for placing, paying for, and picking up orders, though the latter two steps are frequently combined;[48] it was first introduced in Sierra Vista, Arizona in 1975,[49] following the lead of other fast-food chains. The first such restaurant in Britain opened at Fallowfield, Manchester in 1986.[50]</p>
